# Toy Delphi Interpreter
For the purposes of the assignment, I have implemented classes and objects, constructors and destructors, encapsulation, and a
very small subset of Pascal. Anything I didn't think was directly required for these things was not implemented.
## Functionalities Implemented
- Object/unit declaration and implementation
- Object field permissions/encapsulation
- Function/procedure declaration and implementation
- Constructor/destructor declaration and implementation
- Variable declaration, assignment, and manipulation
- Arithmetic expressions

## Functionalities *Not* Implemented
- Loops
- Goto statements and labels
- Conditional statements
- Comparative expressions
- `With x Do y` statements
- Object inheritance
- Object interfaces
- Packed, pointer, string, subrange, and scalar (`( ident, ident, ident )`) variable declarations
- Array variables
